Zabbix2::API

* About Zabbix2::API

Zabbix is a free software monitoring solution.  This distribution is
an abstraction layer over the JSON-RPC API provided by Zabbix,
allowing you to log in, create, update, delete, and generally
manipulate many (but as of yet not all) types of objects, all in Perl
with Perlish constructs.

This distribution is not backwards compatible with Zabbix::API, from
which it was resurrected.

* About the authors

Zabbix::API was originally written by Uperto for SFR, a French ISP and
telecom.  Zabbix2::API however was almost entirely rewritten.  For
most modules, the copyright is retained by SFR, as far as I can tell.
Some other modules were initially written wholly on another company's
time, or on my own; these are marked with the relevant copyright
notice.

* Installation

This distribution supports installation via Module::Build:

  perl Build.pl [OPTIONS]
  ./Build
  ./Build test
  ./Build install

Check out https://metacpan.org/module/Module::Build for documentation
on how to use Module::Build installers.

Alternatively, you can trust the various CPAN clients to pull the
distribution and install it automagically, along with any dependencies
you might be missing.
